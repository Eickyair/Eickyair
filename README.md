### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Software Engineer?
The most important reason why I decided to study this career is because I found a real way to help people work less on repetitive tasks and focus their energy on more important things. With the great advances in the field of AI, I believe I'm on the right path to achieving my goal.
### Studies
Currently, I am studying software engineering at UNAM where I have acquired the most basic knowledge that is summarized in two courses: Data Structures and Algorithms I and II. The topics include:
- Stacks, Lists, Queues, Graphs, Trees
- Discrete Mathematics, Recursion, Algorithmic Complexity

On the other hand, I have decided to study and learn some web development tools on my own, which include:
- HTML, CSS, JS
- Node, React, Express
### Data Scientist
Right now I'm learning the basics to become a data scientist because I'm blown away by the capabilities of this area and I've always been interested in the business and entrepreneurship side of things
### Competitive Programing
I've taken part in competitions like <a href="https://icpc.global/">ICPC</a>or <a href="https://ieeextreme.org/">IEEEXTREME</a>, and with my team we reached the top 9 in Mexico for the latter. A big part of my achievements in this field are thanks to my school club, the <a href="https://github.com/CPCFI-org">CPCFI</a>, where I found people with similar interests and we all bonded over solving problems.
