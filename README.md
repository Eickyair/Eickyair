### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Is Software Engineering My Calling?
I chose to pursue a career in software engineering because I'm passionate about helping people streamline their work and focus on the important stuff. With the rapid advancements in AI, I'm confident that I'm on the right path to make a meaningful impact.

## Studies: Unlocking the Basics
Currently, I'm studying software engineering at <a href="https://www.unam.mx">UNAM</a>, where I'm mastering the basics of the field. The two most pivotal courses I've taken are **Data Structures and Algorithms I and II**, which cover topics such as **Stacks, Lists, Queues, Graphs, Trees, Discrete Mathematics, Recursion, and Algorithmic Complexity**.

In addition, I'm self-studying some **web development** tools like HTML, CSS, JS, **Node, React, and Express**. This keeps me ahead of the curve and makes me well-rounded.

## Data Scientist in the Making
I'm currently exploring the fascinating world of data science. It's astounding how powerful this field is, and I'm always intrigued by the business and entrepreneurship side of things.

## Competitive Programming: Top of the Game
I've also competed in prestigious programming competitions like <a href="https://icpc.global/">ICPC</a> and <a href="https://ieeextreme.org/">IEEEXTREME</a>, and I'm proud to say that my team placed in the top 9 in Mexico for the latter. None of this would have been possible without the support of my school club, <a href="http://www.cpcfi.unam.mx:3000/">CPCFI</a>, where I found like-minded individuals who shared my passion for problem-solving.

I'm excited about the future and can't wait to make a difference in the world of software engineering!
